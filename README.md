This is a prototype (a really rough one) of RESTful back-end web service for a basic social media platform that
can accept requests over HTTP to fulfill the following requirements:
- Can create Posts with a subject line and a mandatory body of text
- Can list posts that have been created on the service
- Can create Replies to Posts
- For a given Post, can list Replies that were made on that Post
- Can create replies to replies
- For a given reply, can list Replies that were made on that Reply.
